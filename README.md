Given a positive integer \( M \) represented by a list \( L \), where each element in the list represents one digit of the number (the most significant digit is in the first element of \( L \), and the least significant digit is in the last element of \( L \)).

Write a function `void List_num_add(List* L, int N)` that receives a list \( L \) representing the number \( M \) and a positive integer \( N \).

The function should increase \( M \) by the number \( N \), meaning that \( L \) should be updated to represent \( M + N \). It is important to ensure that there is sufficient memory allocated to store the updated list if necessary.

**Note:** You should not create a new list but instead update the original list.

**Example:**

The number 9994 is represented by the list \( L \), where the digits appear as follows:

\( [9] \rightarrow [9] \rightarrow [9] \rightarrow [4] \)

After adding 18, the list \( L \) should look like this:

\( [1] \rightarrow [0] \rightarrow [0] \rightarrow [1] \rightarrow [2] \)
